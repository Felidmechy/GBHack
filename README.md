This is a little reverse engineering project I started around the beginning of 2021.

Ive always loved this game, ever since I was a kid. I wanted to mod this a couple years ago but the original version of the game has DRM in it that makes modding difficult (can't attach debuggers, etc).

When the game was remastered in 2019, the engine was slightly modified. The game had all the DRM stripped out from what I can tell, and the game was compiled for x64 CPUs. This opened up a much easier modding opportunity.

I might start a modding community or something out of this, but I will decide as I go.

This is of course Windows only as the original game is Windows only.

I might set up a more universal build system later, but right now I'm using a Visual Studio 2019 project.
